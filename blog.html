                    <p> The word graduate can mean very different things depending on whether it’s used as a noun (as in recent high school graduates), an adjective (as in graduate student and graduate degree), or a verb (as in I plan to graduate next May). The same goes for its shortened form, grad, which can be used as a noun (as in Congrats, grads!) or an adjective (as in grad program).
                    

                        <p>Undergraduate can also be used both as a noun (as in I’m an undergraduate at Stanford University) or an adjective (as in I’m working toward my undergraduate degree). It can be shortened to undergrad in both cases.
                        
                        By the end of this article, you’ll have an advanced degree in all the different ways graduate, grad, undergraduate, and undergrad are used, and what they mean in each case.
                        
                      
                        The main difference between undergraduate and graduate is that undergraduate is always used in the context of the first level of college or university education (the level where you can earn a bachelor’s degree). In terms like graduate student and graduate degree, graduate refers to a level of advanced education beyond the undergraduate level, especially a master’s degree or doctorate. The noun graduate is more general, simply referring to a person who has completed a level of education (someone who has graduated).</p>
                        
                        
                        <h1>What does undergraduate mean?</h1>


                        <P>An undergraduate is “a student in a university or college who has not received a first, especially a bachelor’s, degree.” For example, a college student might say I’m an undergraduate at the University of Texas if they were pursuing a bachelor’s degree there.
                        
                        Undergraduate is also commonly used as an adjective in this same context, in terms like undergraduate student, undergraduate degree, and undergraduate studies.
                        
                        Undergraduate is often shortened to undergrad as both a noun and an adjective.</p>
                        
                        <p>In undergraduate, the prefix under- is used to indicate a lower rank or status. The educational status of an undergraduate student is below that of a graduate student.
                        
                        What’s the difference between wisdom and knowledge? Here’s a lesson on the two terms.
                        
                        
                        What is an undergraduate student? And what is an undergraduate degree?
                        An undergraduate student is a student who is pursuing a degree at the first level of higher education (meaning the level after high school) at a college or university. Undergraduate students are typically those working to earn a bachelor’s degree (or, less commonly, an associate’s degree). These degrees are often referred to with the general term undergraduate degree.</p>
                        
                        <p>Outside of the US, an undergraduate degree is sometimes called a first degree. There are also other types of undergraduate degrees outside of the US, such as a foundation degree (which, like an associate’s degree, is typically a two-year degree).
                        
                        What does graduate mean?
                        As a noun, the word graduate [ graj-oo-it ] refers to “a person who has received a degree or diploma on completing a course of study.” In other words, a graduate is someone who has completed a particular level of schooling or an educational program—a child who just finished kindergarten and a doctor who just completed medical school are both graduates. It can even be used figuratively, as in She’s a graduate of the school of hard knocks.</p>
                        
                        <p>As a verb, graduate [ graj-oo-eyt ] means “to receive a degree or diploma on completing a course of study.” The process of graduating—and the ceremony itself—is called graduation.</p>
                        
                        <p>As an adjective, graduate [ graj-oo-it ] means something more specific. It’s used to indicate that a student, degree, or educational program is an advanced one, beyond the level of a bachelor’s degree. This sense of graduate is most commonly used in terms like graduate degree, graduate school, graduate program, and graduate student.
                        
                        What is a graduate degree? And what is a graduate student?
                        Graduate degree typically refers to a degree beyond a bachelor’s, most commonly a master’s.
